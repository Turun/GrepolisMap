For a release I need to:

- update the Version number in `Cargo.toml`
- update the Version number displayed in the Title bar (defined in main.rs)
- make new commit with these changes
- tag that commit with the version number
- push tags to github
- Write the Changelog in the release on Github
- optionally compile for more targets locally and upload those to Github
